description: | 
  Be a ticket checker at Squaw Valley meant be in daily touch with the resort's guests, welcoming those who would practice snow sports, instructing them about the mountain conditions and assisting the resolution of problems involving their passes.
  
  This experience was important for the improvement of English through contact with natives, immersion in their culture, demand for agile resolution of problems and costumer service.
  in addition, the adaptation to long working days outside in a very distinct climate also composed great professional maturation in the period.
