description: |
  Maxtrack is one of the largest latin-american companies in providing computational infrastructure for people and vehicle monitoring.

  Thus, by compose one of its remote squads under the Analytics team, I supported the maintenance of several highly-available REST APIs, built over multiple services in a complete cloud-native distributed architecture; And I also worked on improving their robust data receiving pipeline, which computes, cleans, processes and persists the monitoring information received uninterruptedly from more than 3 millions devices.

  Combining activities related to Repository maintenance, SaaS development and Data science, this role expanded and deepened my practical use of several industry-standard open-source tools in a production environment.
