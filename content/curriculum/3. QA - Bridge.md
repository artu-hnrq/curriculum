description: |
  During this period, I worked executing exploratory test, describing test case, reporting bugs and suggesting improvements, in order to ensure the proper functioning of a huge application.

  Integrating a 10-person quality assurance dedicated team, guarantee the correct persistence of information and evaluate the reliability of the platform even in the most atypical scenarios were some of my commonplace responsibilities. Beside that, testing of black-box, load, performance, concurrence and security also made part of the daily work.
